      Dialogue (use exactly, keep sentence breaks as pauses):
      「結論。タイミングより『1日の総摂取量』が重要。 
        これが科学的な根拠です。 
        だから、トレーニング後の30分には、もう拘らない。 
        食事と合わせ、1日の中で均等に摂る。これが新しい常識。 
        ただし注意点。これは一般トレーニーの話。 
        まず総量を満たす。それが全ての基本です。」

      Motion: maintain dolly-in + gentle arc keyed to line emphasis on “総摂取量”.
      Ambience: subtle page rustle sfx at first graph point (very low -28 LUFS), otherwise clean.
