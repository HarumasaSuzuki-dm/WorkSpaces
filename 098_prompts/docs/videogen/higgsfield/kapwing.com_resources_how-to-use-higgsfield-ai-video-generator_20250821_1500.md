## What is Higgsfield AI?

Higgsfield AI is a new AI video generator designed to achieve cinematic results, allowing [creators](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/tag/content-creator/) to use the tool when building scenes in professional productions like movies, commercials, or film projects. Segmented by subscription tiers, Higgsfield offers expanded tools at each level, including watermark-free exports, commercially licensed content, and turbo-speed video generation.

With a cinematic focus in mind, Higgsfield AI offers two standout features that aren’t commonly found in other video generators:

- **Cinematic Motion Controls** – [Generate realistic camera shots](https://higgsfield.ai/create/video) incorporating natural movements to add depth and immersion to a scene. Best of all, Higgsfield's built-in motion controls are user-friendly and don’t require extensive videography experience to use.

- **Iconic Scenes** – [Recreate iconic scenes](https://higgsfield.ai/scene) from movies and TV shows in varying animation styles, blending the styles seamlessly.

![List of example 'iconic scenes' as found on Higgsfield's AI generator. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/image-1.png)Instantly recreate iconic film scenes in varying styles.

Interestingly, the “Iconic Scenes” feature on Higgsfield has recently gained traction alongside ChatGPT’s image generator, as trends like the [Studio Ghibli filter](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/so-you-created-a-studio-ghibli-meme-with-chatgpt-what-next/) have shown the potential for AI to recreate and blend art styles.

However, Higgsfield AI appears to be the first major platform to successfully introduce this capability in video generation.

* * *

## How to Use the Higgsfield AI Video Generator

To begin, head to [the Higgsfield website](https://higgsfield.ai/) and hover over the **Create** button in the top-left corner.

This will expand two options — one for image and one for video generation.

![Guide showing how to access the Higgsfield AI video generator. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Higgsfield-Create-Button.png)Hover over the **Create** button to begin generating an image or video.

After selecting **Video**, you'll be brought to a screen showing a simple three-step guide to generating a video.

![Higgsfield AI video interface showing how to generate a video. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/image-4.png)Use the configuration window on the left-side to generate a video.

To actually generate a video, the configuration window on the left-hand side is the only place you will need to input anything.

### 1\. Motion Controls

To get started, begin with the Motion Control setting.

Here, you can see your current motion (highlighted in green), click " **Mix**" to combine multiple motions, or select " **Change**" to choose a different one.

![Guide showing how to select a motion control on Higgsfield AI. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Higgsfield-Generation-Guide-1.png)Select the **Change** button to choose your desired camera motion.

Selecting the **Change** button will open a comprehensive list of available motion controls.

This list is especially helpful for beginners or those unfamiliar with cinematic camera movements.

![Example list of Higgsfield's motion controls.](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/image-5.png)Select from the large list of available motion controls. A small preview of each control will be shown after selecting.

### 2\. Reference Image

Once you've selected your desired motion, the next field to complete is the reference image.

In this field, either upload a reference image or select the **Generate it** button to access the Higgsfield image generator.

![Guide showing where to upload a reference image to begin generating a Higgsfield AI video. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Higgsfield-Generation-Guide-2.png)Upload or generate a reference image to begin generating a video.

Since Higgsfield is generating a video with lots of movement, you'll want to keep in mind details like your subject and background in your reference image. A moving camera means your subject will be shown from multiple angles, so specific elements like clothing or background objects may shift slightly from the original image.

After uploading your image, you can optionally upload an end frame for the video to conclude on. Only upload an end frame if it’s visually close enough to the original for the video to logically bridge the two.

![Higgsfield AI end frame video option.](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/image-6.png)Optionally add an end frame to your video.

### 3\. Enter a Prompt

The final mandatory element in configuring your generation is to enter a prompt.

![Guide showing where to enter a Higgsfield AI generation prompt. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Higgsfield-Generation-Guide-3.png)Enter a generation prompt to guide the video generator.

The prompt stage of AI video generation is where many users struggle — a lack of specificity leaves too much room for interpretation, while overdescribing can pull the model away from your intended direction.

To help with this, Higgsfield offers an **Enhance** option.

![Higgsfield AI prompt box with the enhance button highlighted. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Higgsfield-Prompt-Enhancement.png)**Enhance** greatly expands your prompt and makes it more AI-friendly.

With enhancement enabled, Higgsfield will automatically convert your prompt into an AI-friendly version that includes details relevant to the selected motion type, resulting in a more reliable output.

Here’s how it converted one of my prompts:

**Original Prompt**

> A content man holding a large brown Labrador retriever gazes wistfully at a mountainous forest as the sun begins to set, casting soft pastel lighting across the sky

**Enhanced Prompt**

> In a serene mountainous landscape, the sun prepares to set, casting soft pastel hues across the sky. A content man effortlessly cradles his large brown Labrador retriever, both gazing wistfully into the distance. As he stands upon the rugged earth, a gentle swell of magic begins to unfold — the man starts to rise slowly, defying gravity, his feet lifting gracefully from the ground. The dog's fur dances lightly in the evening breeze as they ascend, suspended between earth and sky. The scene is imbued with tranquility, every detail enhanced: the warmth of the sunset illuminating their features, the rustle of autumn leaves carried by the whispers of wind. A soft hum fills the air, blending with the peaceful silence, creating a dreamlike atmosphere where they float and embrace the freedom of flight, symbolizing emotional liberation and transcendent joy.

As you can see, the enhanced prompt adds significant detail to improve generation quality. Additionally, it incorporates language that directly supports your chosen camera movement, thus ensuring better results.

The only downside is that you don’t have much control over what’s added. This is especially important for free users with limited generations, but it’s worth considering regardless.

### 4\. (Optional) Model Selection & Advanced Configuration

Finally, you can optionally adjust the generation model and advanced video settings if desired.

![Guide showing how to access Higgsfield's advanced video tools.](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Higgsfield-Generation-Guide-4.png)Select either of these buttons to access the advanced generation tools.

Model selection is limited to paid users — free users only have access to the standard model.

Advanced video settings are available to all users, though currently limited to **duration** and **seed** controls.

![Side-by-side image comparing Higgsfield's advanced generation settings. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Higgsfield-Advanced-Settings-1.png)Configure advanced settings like your generation model.

### 5\. Generating and Downloading

Once configured, begin your generation by selecting the large **Generate** button at the bottom of the window.

![Guide showing how to generate Higgsfield AI videos. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Higgsfield-Generation-Guide-5.png)Select the **Generate** button to begin processing.

While using a free plan, I found that a five-second video took about seven minutes to generate. I also had a few notable observations during the process:

- **No progress bar**: While not essential, a progress bar is always helpful when generating AI videos. Higgsfield does not currently include one.
- **Very CPU-intensive**: During generation, my computer slowed down significantly, with the CPU under heavy load. Other browser tabs became incredibly slow, making it difficult to multitask while waiting.

Fortunately, downloading your generated video is simple. Hover over any generated video to make the download icon appear in the top right corner. Then, select it to download your video watermark-free.

![Guide showing how to download Higgsfield AI generated videos. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Higgsfield-Video-Download.png)Hover over your video and select the **download** icon.

## Higgsfield Video Specs: How to Resize

While future updates may bring higher framerates, longer durations, and expanded file-type support, here’s a breakdown of Higgsfield’s current video specs:

- **Video length:** Configurable to be 3 or 5 seconds
- **Frames per second:** 30
- **Resolution:** Downscaled to 720p
- **File type:** MP4
- **File size:** Approximately 20–25 MB
- **Aspect ratio:** Same as reference image

This last point is especially important, as the aspect ratio often determines whether a video is usable in a specific project. For example, professional film projects are almost always created in landscape aspect ratios.

Alternatively, mobile-first content like [social media](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/tag/social-media/) clips is best viewed when captured vertically. As a result, providing a reference image in the correct aspect ratio is crucial to producing a usable final video.

Here is how to [resize a reference photo for free](https://www.kapwing.com/tools/resize/image) to ensure it has the correct aspect ratio before generating a Higgsfield AI video:

Start by uploading your image to [the Kapwing editor](https://www.kapwing.com/studio/editor). For the best results, use a clear image with a visible subject.

After uploading, select the background of your project to access the **Resize Project** tool.

![Guide showing how to resize reference images for Higgsfield AI. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Kapwing-Resize-Project.png)Select the background of your project to access the **Resize Project** tool.

In the resize menu, expand the **Size** dropdown to choose from preset aspect ratios or enter custom dimensions. Since I want to optimize my video for mobile display, I selected the **TikTok 9:16** aspect ratio preset.

To apply the changes, select the **Resize Project** button at the bottom of the menu.

![Guide showing how to resize reference images for Higgsfield AI. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Kapwing-Resize-Project-Menu.png)Select a preset aspect ratio or enter custom image dimensions in the **Size** dropdown.

Finally, adjust how your reference image is framed by cropping it. To crop an image, double-click it, then drag the image within the frame to ensure all important details are visible.

![Guide showing how to crop reference image for Higgsfield AI. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/Kapwing-Crop-Image.png)Double-click your image to crop it.

Once complete, you’ll have a resized reference image ready to upload to Higgsfield for video generation. The final video will match this aspect ratio, eliminating the need to resize later.

If you generate a video in Higgsfield and later realize it needs to be resized, you can follow the same steps above — just upload your video instead of an image.

## Pricing

As an [advanced AI video generator](https://www.kapwing.com/ai-video-generator), Higgsfield operates on a premium subscription model. These subscriptions give users expanded access to the tool, including higher generation limits, access to multiple models, priority queueing, and enhanced camera motion options.

Here is a breakdown of what each tier includes and its cost.

_Note: All listed prices reflect the **annual billing rate**, meaning they are charged in one upfront payment (12 × the monthly price). Monthly billing is available, though the **Pro** and **Ultimate** tiers are 30% more expensive on a monthly plan._

![Higgsfield AI subscription pricing table for video generation. ](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/content/images/2025/05/image-7.png)Compare pricing to find the best subscription tier for your AI video needs.

### Free-Trial

The free-trial tier of the Higgsfield video generator allows users to test the platform before making a purchase. Specifically, users receive **two video generations** and access to a wide range of camera movements. I found this tier to be sufficient for understanding how the tool works and whether it fits your workflow.

It’s worth noting that while the Higgsfield website states free-user videos include a watermark, each video I created and exported during my trial did not feature any watermark.

### Basic – $9/month

The Basic tier is a solid option for casual creators who don’t need Higgsfield for every project. With up to **30 video generations per month**, this plan is ideal for producing short clips that can be incorporated into other content, even with some trial and error.

### Pro – $20/month

Geared toward professionals, the Pro plan expands usage limits with **120 video generations per month** and support for **3 concurrent jobs**. This tier is best suited for digital marketers, freelance editors, and content creators looking to streamline production and scale output efficiently.

### Ultimate – $55/month

The Ultimate plan is designed for teams, agencies, and film studios that need consistent access to high-volume video generation. It includes **up to 300 generations per month**, access to **all motion controls**, and support for **4 concurrent jobs** making it the most powerful option for professional content pipelines.

In addition to monthly generation limits, premium subscribers can purchase extra credits as needed. This provides a flexible option if you temporarily need to produce more content without upgrading your plan. Purchased credits remain active for a 90-day period, allowing you to extend your usage during busier production cycles.
