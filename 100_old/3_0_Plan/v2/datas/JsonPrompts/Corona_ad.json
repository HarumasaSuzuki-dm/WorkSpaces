  "description": "Cinematic close-up of a cold, dewy Corona bottle sitting alone on a weathered beach table. It begins to hum, vibrate. The bottle cap *pops*—and the entire environment unfolds from inside: palm trees rise, lights string themselves, speakers assemble mid-air, sand shifts into a dance floor. A DJ booth builds from driftwood. Music kicks in. A beach rave is born. No text.",
