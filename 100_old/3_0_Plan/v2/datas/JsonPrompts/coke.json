    "description": "A hyper-realistic shot of a single, perfect, healthy white human tooth, gleaming in a beam of light against a dark background. Suddenly, a crack runs through it, and it explodes with a crunch. A violent torrent of dark, fizzy liquid erupts from the fragments, which then transforms into a tsunami of millions of plastic Coca-Cola bottles. This wave crashes down with a roar onto a pristine paradise beach with white sand, burying it completely.",
    "style": "hyperrealistic, shock-content, epic scale",
    "camera": "starts with a studio macro shot. Then transitions to a fast, dynamic camera following the torrent, ending with a wide, overhead drone shot of the disaster.",
    "lighting": "at the beginning - clean, bright, clinical light. At the end - gloomy, dirty tones with harsh glares from the wet plastic.",
    "location": "first - a black studio void, then - a paradise tropical beach.",
