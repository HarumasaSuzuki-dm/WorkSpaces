    "description": "Cinematic sequence begins in a dark, futuristic sci-fi chamber. A mysterious, glowing box levitates at the center, surrounded by subtle floating particles and beams of light. The box hums, pulses, and slowly opens—releasing a soft burst of energy. In one seamless transition, the environment morphs from this sci-fi setting into a pristine, modern studio. The box's contents materialize into furniture and decor, assembling themselves with precision and elegance, forming a fully designed Scandinavian-inspired interior. No text.",
